### 🦍 **Ape Tribe’s Guide to the Legendary ApeBananaEncryptor** 🍌

---

**OOOH OOOOH! BANANA ENCRYPTION FOR BIG BRAIN APES ONLY!** 🧠🦍

Welcome, mighty apes of the internet jungle! Today, King Kong himself has blessed us with the secrets of the **ApeBananaEncryptor**, the ultimate weapon to protect your shiny bananas from sneaky monkeys! 🦍🍌 This isn’t just code—it’s a declaration of ape superiority! Let’s peel this banana and see what’s inside! 🍌🔧

### 🛠️ **ApeTools We Borrowed**

- **`rand::{Rng, SeedableRng}`** 🌀
  - Makes random banana magic happen.
  - `Rng`: Throws dice for apes!
  - `SeedableRng`: Helps apes remember how they threw the dice. Smart ape stuff.

- **`rand_chacha::ChaCha20Rng`** 🎲
  - Fancy ape randomness tool. Not always used here but added for ape flex. 🦍💪

- **`base64::{engine::general_purpose, Engine}`** 📜
  - Turns boring bytes into tasty, readable banana mush. Safe for ape eyes. 👀🍌

### 🍌 **What’s the Deal with ApeBananaEncryptor?**

It’s a super-ape tool for:
1. Mangling your precious banana messages. 🍌➡️🦍➡️🤔
2. Spitting out gibberish filled with emojis and ape words.
3. Reversing the magic (if you have the **ape seed**) to get your bananas back. 🦍🍌➡️🔑➡️📜

### 🏗️ **The Blueprint: ApeBananaEncryptor**

```rust
pub struct ApeBananaEncryptor {
    seed: String,
}
```

- **`seed`**: The sacred banana password. Protect it like a hoard of shiny bananas. DO NOT SHARE, EVEN WITH OTHER APES! 🛡️🍌

### 🦍 **Big Ape Magic Explained**

#### **1. `new()` - Build the Banana Protector**

**Translation for Apes:**
- Ape king calls this to build a banana-protecting machine.
- Feed it your special **ape seed**, and it’s ready to guard your fruity treasures.

#### **2. `encrypt()` - Turn Bananas into Gibberish**

**What Happens Inside the Jungle:**
1. Wrap your banana message with **`APESSTRONK`** and **`BANANA`**. 🍌💪
2. Scramble letters like a confused chimp using byte rotations. 🙉
3. Add random **banana sprinkles** for extra confusion. 🍌✨
4. Pack everything together (IV, encrypted gibberish, and offsets).
5. Spice it up with emojis and ape sayings like:
   - **“OOOH OOOH!”**
   - **“BANANA TIME!”**
   - **“APE STRONK!”**

**Result:** A ridiculous string that looks like a chimp threw emojis at it. 🙈

---

#### **3. `decrypt()` - Bring the Bananas Back!**

**What Happens Inside the Jungle:**
1. Remove all the **ape nonsense** (emojis and sayings).
2. Reverse the transformations (un-scramble the bytes).
3. Strip off the **`APESSTRONK`** and **`BANANA`** wrapping.
4. Voilà! Your bananas are back where they belong. 🍌🎉

---

### 🔒 **How Secure is This Ape Magic?**

**Short Answer:** Not very. 🙊

**Why?**
- It’s like using banana peels for locks—fun but easy to break.
- Byte rotation and random offsets? A curious monkey could figure it out.
- Hardcoded seed? Big ape no-no. Real apes use vaults! 🔐

---

### 🍌 **King Kong’s Jungle Rules**

- **Encrypt:** Protect your bananas!
  ```rust
  let encrypted_message = encryptor.encrypt("YourSecretBananaMessage!");
  ```
- **Decrypt:** Bring the bananas back!
  ```rust
  let decrypted_message = encryptor.decrypt(&encrypted_message);
  ```

---

### 🦍 **Main Jungle Playground**

```rust
fn main() {
    let king_seed = "MIGHTY_RUST_APE_SEED"; // Sacred seed from Kong himself.
    let encryptor = ApeBananaEncryptor::new(king_seed);

    let message = "ProtectTheShinyBananas!";
    println!("Original Message: {}", message);

    let encrypted_message = encryptor.encrypt(message);
    println!("Encrypted Message: {}", encrypted_message);

    let decrypted_message = encryptor.decrypt(&encrypted_message);
    println!("Decrypted Message: {}", decrypted_message);
}
```

### 🚨 **Ape Pro Tips** 

1. **DO NOT** use this for real secrets. This is for ape giggles, not human security.
2. Keep the **ape seed** safe. Without it, your bananas are lost forever. 🍌💔
3. Add more emojis. Everything is better with 🍌 and 🦍.
