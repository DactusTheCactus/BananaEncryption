🦍 Ape Tribe’s Guide to the Legendary ApeBananaEncryptor 🍌
OOOH OOOOH! BANANA ENCRYPTION FOR BIG BRAIN APES ONLY! 🧠🦍

Welcome, mighty apes of the internet jungle! Today, King Kong himself has blessed us with the secrets of the ApeBananaEncryptor, the ultimate weapon to protect your shiny bananas from sneaky monkeys! 🦍🍌 This isn’t just code—it’s a declaration of ape superiority! Let’s peel this banana and see what’s inside! 🍌🔧

🛠️ ApeTools We Borrowed
rand::{Rng, SeedableRng} 🌀

Makes random banana magic happen.
Rng: Throws dice for apes!
SeedableRng: Helps apes remember how they threw the dice. Smart ape stuff.
rand_chacha::ChaCha20Rng 🎲

Fancy ape randomness tool. Not always used here but added for ape flex. 🦍💪
base64::{engine::general_purpose, Engine} 📜

Turns boring bytes into tasty, readable banana mush. Safe for ape eyes. 👀🍌
🍌 What’s the Deal with ApeBananaEncryptor?
It’s a super-ape tool for:

Mangling your precious banana messages. 🍌➡️🦍➡️🤔
Spitting out gibberish filled with emojis and ape words.
Reversing the magic (if you have the ape seed) to get your bananas back. 🦍🍌➡️🔑➡️📜
🏗️ The Blueprint: ApeBananaEncryptor
rust
Copia codice
pub struct ApeBananaEncryptor {
    seed: String,
}
seed: The sacred banana password. Protect it like a hoard of shiny bananas. DO NOT SHARE, EVEN WITH OTHER APES! 🛡️🍌
🦍 Big Ape Magic Explained
1. new() - Build the Banana Protector
Translation for Apes:

Ape king calls this to build a banana-protecting machine.
Feed it your special ape seed, and it’s ready to guard your fruity treasures.
2. encrypt() - Turn Bananas into Gibberish
What Happens Inside the Jungle:

Wrap your banana message with APESSTRONK and BANANA. 🍌💪
Scramble letters like a confused chimp using byte rotations. 🙉
Add random banana sprinkles for extra confusion. 🍌✨
Pack everything together (IV, encrypted gibberish, and offsets).
Spice it up with emojis and ape sayings like:
“OOOH OOOH!”
“BANANA TIME!”
“APE STRONK!”
Result: A ridiculous string that looks like a chimp threw emojis at it. 🙈

3. decrypt() - Bring the Bananas Back!
What Happens Inside the Jungle:

Remove all the ape nonsense (emojis and sayings).
Reverse the transformations (un-scramble the bytes).
Strip off the APESSTRONK and BANANA wrapping.
Voilà! Your bananas are back where they belong. 🍌🎉
🔒 How Secure is This Ape Magic?
Short Answer: Not very. 🙊

Why?

It’s like using banana peels for locks—fun but easy to break.
Byte rotation and random offsets? A curious monkey could figure it out.
Hardcoded seed? Big ape no-no. Real apes use vaults! 🔐
🍌 King Kong’s Jungle Rules
Encrypt: Protect your bananas!
rust
Copia codice
let encrypted_message = encryptor.encrypt("YourSecretBananaMessage!");
Decrypt: Bring the bananas back!
rust
Copia codice
let decrypted_message = encryptor.decrypt(&encrypted_message);
🦍 Main Jungle Playground
rust
Copia codice
fn main() {
    let king_seed = "MIGHTY_RUST_APE_SEED"; // Sacred seed from Kong himself.
    let encryptor = ApeBananaEncryptor::new(king_seed);

    let message = "ProtectTheShinyBananas!";
    println!("Original Message: {}", message);

    let encrypted_message = encryptor.encrypt(message);
    println!("Encrypted Message: {}", encrypted_message);

    let decrypted_message = encryptor.decrypt(&encrypted_message);
    println!("Decrypted Message: {}", decrypted_message);
}
🚨 Ape Pro Tips
DO NOT use this for real secrets. This is for ape giggles, not human security.
Keep the ape seed safe. Without it, your bananas are lost forever. 🍌💔
Add more emojis. Everything is better with 🍌 and 🦍.
👑 Final Words from King Kong
"OOOH OOOH! Apes together strong! Protect your bananas and spread the wisdom of the ApeBananaEncryptor across the jungle! MIGHTY APES!!!" 🦍🍌
